#Class 1 Reading Assignment.

*These are my notes from Module 1*

A shortcut to type Markdown with the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Examples:
* Use the ** bracketing text to use bold typeface.
* The_character enclosing text will apply italics.
* Three *** will apply italicized bold characters.
* The # character will give you a heading depending on how many characters you use.

That is how you use Markdown.
