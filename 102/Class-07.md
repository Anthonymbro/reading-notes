Good code is DRY code: Don’t Repeat Yourself

Functions, a way to make the code that we write re-usable.

Variable that stores code.

FUNCTIONS REVIEW:

* Keep functions concise.
* Naming conventions.
* Too many parameters get a little confusing.
* Functions are a great way to re-use code.
* Great way to keep code organized

NEW TERMINOLOGY

* Arguments- Values passed into a function.
* Parameters- The way we get those values in the function signature.
* Function signature/ Function declaration - All the code that makes up a function.
* Function invocation - the execution of that code in the signature / declaration.
* ‘Return’ statement - pushes a value out of the function + ends the function invocation.
