### ANSWER

What is the purpose of CSS?
The purpose of CSS is to provide style to our page. When adding to HTML, we add a style tag. Currently this is being used to add color and change sizes in our web page.

What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?

1. We can change the color of our background in our webpage.
2. We can change the size of our pictures in our webpage.
3. We can target classes we have assigned to specific elements in our HTML file.

p {

    color: red;
}
