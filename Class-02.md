The difference between a text editor and and IDE. The article given to us says that a text editor is just an editor of text and that an IDE is a text editor, debugger, etc but personally with my limited practice of both of these things, I cannot see the difference yet. I have used VS Code and Sololearn’s IDE for reference. They both have syntax highlighting for example.

Answer
What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

1. Code Completion.
2. Syntax highlighting.
3. A nice variety of themes to reduce eye strain and fatigue.
4. The ability to choose from a variety of extensions when you need them.

What do the following commands do?
pwd     Print working directory tells you where you are in the terminal
ls         List. This is listing what is in the directory you are currently in.
cd.       Change directory. This is to change the directory of what you’re looking at.
mkdir         Make directory to make a new place to look at.
touch.       Allows you to create new files from the terminal.

Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
    1. cd projects     This changes the directory to the projects directory.
    2. mkdir new-project.      This makes a new directory called “new_project.”
    3. touch new-project/newfile.md      This makes a new file by that name.
    4. cd ..     This goes back a previous directory.
    5. ls projects/new-project      This lists all of the stuff inside of the new-project directory.
