1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

In cyberspace, where data sails,
HTTP sets forth, its mission unveiled.
Requests and responses, a language it speaks,
Connecting computers, with data it seeks.
Through cables and routers, it swiftly flies,
Transferring information, under digital skies.
Bytes in packets, through the network they glide,
HTTP's journey, a seamless ride.
From client to server, the connection is made,
Data flows freely, like a cascading cascade.
With rhyme and reason, it links our machines,
HTTP, the bridge, where data convenes.

2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.
Parsing is when the browser looks at the different parts of a webpage and puts them together like a puzzle to make what we see. It sees HTML as the structure of the webpage. We see things like text or tables with this. CSS is the style of the webpage. We see things like color or it proportions things in the webpage. Javascript makes the whole thing work. I think so far it is the logic of the webpage. We have just used pop-up questions with multiple responses to the responses of the questions so far.

2. What is the most important question to answer when designing a Website?

What exactly do I want to accomplish with it?

Semantics.
1. Why should you use an < h1 > element over a < span > element to display a top level heading?

An < h1 > element differentiates itself from a < span > element because it is bigger, bolder, and it belongs on top of the webpage as an attention getter. < span > is an inline tag that makes things more highlighted but not as attention grabbing as the heading. It also does not belong in the heading.

1. What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML?

Semantic tags help people and search engines understand the meanings of a webpage. It also helps with search engine optimization to help search engines sort what is most relevant to people who may see the website. It also provides accessibility to make sure that the website is accessible to people.
