4. Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

Gif is Graphics Interchange Format and is usually a short scaled down moving image.

Svg means Scalable Vector Graphics and instead of using pixels to make up the image on its’ own, it uses geography. The shape determines the pixel position and colors so as to make up the image.
