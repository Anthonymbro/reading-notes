3. Padding-The innermost layer outside of the content.

Learn JS
Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.

1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?
You can store booleans, strings, numbers, objects, arrays, functions.

2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?
Yes it is. They can be accessed using their index number.

List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
1. += Addition operator: Adds value on the right side.

2. -= Subtraction operator: Subtracts the value on the right side.
3. /= Division operator: Divides the number on the left by the right
4. %= Remainder operator: Shows the remainder after division.
5. **= Exponent operator: The number times itself however many times the exponent is.

Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

 let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;

The answer is “10dog” because “a” is a number, “b” is a string, and “c” is a boolean. Javascript just said the woolen is a zero and just added the number and string together.

Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.

A conditional statement can be used to see if the interest on a purchase will go down or not depending on if the customer put 20% down vs 10% down on whatever they are buying.

Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.
